# Project Overview and Structure

This project is a Visual Studio Code extension inspired by RepoPrompt, designed to help users select files/folders from their codebase, generate structured XML prompts for LLMs, and apply LLM-suggested changes back to local files.

## Main Features (see [PRD.md](mdc:docs/PRD.md))
- **Project & File Management:**
  - Open a local project folder
  - File tree view with selection (checkboxes), search/filter, and refresh
- **Context Building & Prompt Generation (Compose Tab):**
  - Display selected files
  - Generate `<file_map>` and `<file_contents>` XML tags
  - Include fixed XML formatting instructions
  - User instructions input
  - Copy full prompt to clipboard
- **Applying LLM Changes (Apply Tab):**
  - Paste and parse XML-formatted LLM responses
  - Apply file actions: create, rewrite, modify, delete
  - Feedback and error handling for each change

## UI/UX
- Integration with VS Code: Activity Bar for file selection, Webview Panel for composing and applying prompts
- Clear separation between context building and change application
- Responsive UI using VS Code APIs

## Technical Stack
- **Framework:** VS Code Extension with TypeScript
- **File System:** VS Code APIs for file operations
- **XML Parsing:** Use a suitable library like fast-xml-parser
- **Package Manager:** PNPM

## Important Notes
- When updating permissions, update the extension's manifest or capabilities as needed
